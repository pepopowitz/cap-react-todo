# React TodoMVC Example - Modified for CAP 

This is a modified, standalone version of [the TodoMVC React example](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/tree/master/examples/react).

It is stripped down and standalone, rather than forked from the original, because I only care about the React example.

## Setup

After cloning the repository, you will need to install dependencies.

`npm install`

## Running

Once you've restored dependencies, you can run the app with 

`npm start`.

Then visit http://localhost:3235 to run the app.
